## Where To Start

Please have a look at the Tutorials!

This package is made to facilitate the use of a local, embedded NoSQL database called "NeDB". So it still has Documents and Subdocuments/EmbeddedDocuments at its core - but there are some other nice things introduced in this package that do impact the usage of those features and functionalities.

## Example Projects

Dig through these to see what else can be done with this library, and learn about how it's used in specific types of projects:

- [NodeJS terminal app](https://github.com/BigfootDS/supercamo-example-basic)
- ExpressJS server - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- ElectronJS app - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Those repositories are also used to dogfood this library - features needed for those projects will be prioritised. Check their readme files to see what is mapped out on each repository.
