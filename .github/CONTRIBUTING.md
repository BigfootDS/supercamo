# Contributing

To facilitate fast improvements, our repositories have automation systems set up to parse and support any contributions.

When making your own contributions to a BigfootDS repository, please abide by this process: 

1. Make a branch, or a branch of a fork. Either way, as long as the work has to be _merged_ into the main branch of the repository - that's good.
2. Work however you please within your branch. As many commits as you want, whatever commit messages you want.
3. When making a pull request to the main branch of the repository, give the title of the pull request a descriptive title that obeys [conventional commit syntax](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
4. Wait for a reviewer to review and/or approve your pull request.
5. Wait for the automated system to compile a build including your work.
6. Celebrate! Your contribution is now in the system, it's so awesome!
